## EasyFlow Protocol EFP

EasyFlow Protocol (EFP) is a network protocol focused on ease of use and functionality. The objectives of this protocol are:

1) Facilitate the use of communication over socket connections, TCP, UDP, IPC, QUIC, WSS.
2) Send queries and receive one or multiple responses.
3) Cancel queries in process.
4) Using a single socket connection to have several simultaneous communication channels.
5) Receive information without the need for an associated query, that is, once the connection is established, either end can send data to the other end even if the other end has not made a request.
